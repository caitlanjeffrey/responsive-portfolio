        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my page!</p>
        <p>I’m a California native, that has spent the last 10-years of my life living in Oklahoma. I attended Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, majoring in Animal Science - Agricultural Education Double Major. The focus of my Animal Science degree was Sheep and Goat Science, while pursuing Student Teaching in SW Oklahoma. I graduated from Oklahoma State University in 2012.</p>

        <p>After graduation, I moved around the state and settled back into the Stillwater area. I was hired at Proagrica, an agricultural solutions company, where I spent the last 3-years as the Lead Business Analyst in their precision agriculture and agronomic solutions department. One of the products I helped manage was Sirrus product. The product line includes a web and mobile application for iOS and Android. My focus was on designing new and existing features, working closely with developers, researching new agriculture technologies, writing requirements and managing the day to day progress of the mobile applications.</p>
        <p>When I wasn’t at work, I spent my time working on my farm and garden. On the farm I raised: dairy goats, chickens, ducks, horses and dogs! In the garden, I cared for: fruit trees, asparagus, brussel sprouts, bouquet flowers and an extensive native plant (monarch butterfly safe) garden.</p>
        <p>I'm also an avid indoor gardener with a large collection (over 50!!) of cactus, plants and succulents.</p>
        <p>Today, I live in Davis with my daughter and dogs.</p>
